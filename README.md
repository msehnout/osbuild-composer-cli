# OSBuild Composer CLI client (Work In Progress)

This repo contains a CLI client for osbuild-composer's Weldr API (the one running locally over unix-domain socket). It is a "fork" of `composer-cli` from [lorax](https://github.com/weldr/lorax/) repository. The difference is that this repository does not contain the source code for lorax-composer, which has been replaced by osbuild-composer.

The aim is to move this client under the osbuild orgranization to speed up development and fix longstanding issues with its user-friendliness.
